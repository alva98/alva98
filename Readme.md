- Hello 👋 -- I’m @alva98.
- I’m currently learning to design videogames with Unity and programming with C# in Unity too. 🌱
- I’m interested in finnishing Unity Learning and then Web Development with python (frameworks flask and Django) and html/css.   👀  
-  I’m looking to ending the studies and creating a start-up, a videogames/animation studio. 💞️
- I'm also working in education (high school).
